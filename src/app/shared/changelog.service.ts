- [Fix start minimized](https://discourse.playyourdamnturn.com/t/start-minimized-on-startup/832)

    version: "2.1.0",
    date: "2023-01-10",
    desc: `It's been a long time since I did a client release, but not a lot in here other than version bumps and a couple small things:

- Multiple user support: You can now switch between multiple user tokens in the client with the new User menu.
- Proton/Steam Deck: I still don't think things are great on the steam deck, but I added better detection for proton installations (used by steam deck).
- Fixed a bug with the game store dropdown not displaying the saved selections correctly.`,
  },
  {
    version: "2.0.2",
    date: "2022-02-13",
    desc: `There's no real changes in this release - the 2.0.0 release wasn't able to upgrade 1.6.0 windows to 2.0.0 because of the change in updater/installer format.  This release fakes an upgrade in the old format (playyourdamnturn-2.0.2-full.nupkg and RELEASES), which really just contains the new installer.  The new installer runs, and the PYDT client will check for the old client on startup and run the uninstaller to get rid of it.  See here if you're interested in the details: https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/issues/837#issuecomment-614127460.

(2.0.1 was deleted because I fixed a bug preventing the app from closing when you pressed the update button)
    
Duplicating the note from 2.0.0: **IF YOU USE START CLIENT ON BOOT** you'll need to uncheck the box in settings, save, and then recheck the box because the actual location of the app on the hard drive has changed.`,
  },
  {
    version: "2.0.0",
    date: "2022-02-05",
    desc: `This release is mostly digging out of a lot of technical debt, cleaning things up and getting updated to current versions of everything.  The biggest change is changing how updates on Windows are handled - we were using an old, deprecated installer format (Squirrel.Windows) and this release switches to the current recommended installer, NSIS.  I'm hoping this changeover will be transparent, but it's possible you'll need to manually uninstall/reinstall if you have issues. ðŸ¤ž 

Because of this, **IF YOU USE START CLIENT ON BOOT** you'll need to uncheck the box in settings, save, and then recheck the box because the actual location of the app on the hard drive has changed.
    
**UPDATE:** Windows auto update from 1.6.0 to 2.0.0 isn't working, I'll be releasing 2.0.1 next weekend (2/12ish) that will support auto update from 1.6.0.`,
  },
  {
    version: "1.6.0",
    date: "2020-11-21",
    desc: `A bunch of bugfixes & features (thanks @Valamas for keeping the backlog full), and also getting the client synced up with some improvements from the website.

#23: background turn download (disabled by default, enable in the settings menu, if it doesn't cause a lot of issues I'll make it the default behavior in the future)
#24: cleaned up window close/tray behavior
#37: allow cancelling downloads/uploads
#44: sort turns by: your turn/smack talk/other, sort within by last update`,

    date: "2023-12-05",
    desc: `We're keeping much more detailed statistics on turn activity, which you can see pretty much anywhere turn stats are showed (global/game/user).  Now that we have this, I've added a new "Sort via Play Times" option when sorting players that will take into account their last 100 turns and sort appropriately, so people no longer have to bug Valamas all the time.`,

    date: "2023-07-05",

    date: "2023-06-20",
    desc: `Endgame changes (BETA): I've integrated <a href="https://github.com/viash-io/civ6_pipeline" target="_blank">this Civ 6 replay generator</a> into the game pipeline, it will take one image per turn and then create a video of the game when the game is "finalized" (less than 2 players remain in the game).  The image generation has been running in the background for about a month now, and any turns played before it started running won't be captured in the video.  Also, I've made a few bugfixes to the image generation (and I'm sure there's more things to find) so the video might not be great yet, but definitely let me know if you see issues with the videos.

Also, you can now download your previous turns from the turn history tab, and once the game is finalized you can download any player's turn (but PYDT only keeps the most recent 20 or so saves, so not that far back).`,

Restarting a game is only available during the first two rounds to be able to fix game issues without re-lobbying.  Cloning a game is available to recreate a game for rematches.
- Instead of just an option for "Random Only", you can now force users to choose a leader, choose random, or neither.
- Added an option to allow duplicate leaders.
- The admin can set user civs and boot users before game start in the user detail popup.`,
